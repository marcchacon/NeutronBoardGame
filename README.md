# NeutronBoardGame
This is a JavaScript code to play a very unknown game called [Neutron](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6978/neutron)! 

Thanks to @danielborowski for creating [jsboard](https://github.com/danielborowski/jsboard)!

# Rules
## Moves
The turn consists in two actions: First you move the Neutron (the middle piece), in any direction and always to the end (occupied space or end of board). Then move your pieces, following the same pattern.
I know BGG mentions a slighty different rules, but this is how I play with my friends.
## Winning condition
The main game consists on moving the common piece to your space. Your space consists on the initial row your pieces starts at. If You can't move the Neutron on your turn, you lose.
